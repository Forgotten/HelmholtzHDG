# HelmholtzHDG

This a Matlab experimental code to solve the 2D Helmholtz equation with absorbing boundary conditions implemented via perfectly matched layers (PML), using a Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin discretization. 

The repository is based on the code for the MIT class 16.930, and it is distibuted under the MIT license.

To start you need to setup your path (using the setup.m script) and then you can go to the hdghelmholtz and run the experiments from there.
